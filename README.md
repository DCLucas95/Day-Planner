# Description
<p>The purpose of this project was to create a planner that would keep entries in local storage. Upon refreshing the entries would remain. There is a button at the bottom of the screen to clear all entries into the scheduler. 
</p>

<p>Additionally, the site also uses moment.js to stay updated with the current time zone and will change the colour of the boxes associated with each time of day. Grey means that the hour has passed, red signifies the current hour and green shows a future hour.
</p>
